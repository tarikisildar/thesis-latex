I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor Tobias Kerbl, who provided invaluable guidance, support, and expertise throughout this research journey. His mentorship has been instrumental in shaping both this thesis and my academic development.

I am profoundly grateful to my family for their unwavering support. To my mother Ufuk, father Ibrahim, and my two brothers - your endless encouragement, patience, and belief in my capabilities have given me the strength to pursue my goals.

Finally, I would like to thank my friends who have been an integral part of my journey from Ankara to Munich over the past three years. Your friendship and support have helped me navigate the challenges of academic life while making this experience truly meaningful.
